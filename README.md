# Ontology Training

This repository is organizing training materials for Transnational Access (TA) projects on metadata coverage, data annotation, ontologies and data upload to different databases part of the NanoCommons infrastructure. It is meant as the starting point to bring people on the same page before providing more specific and customized training and technical support.

All the material will be organized and structured in the wiki part of this repository: https://github.com/NanoCommons/OntologyTraining/wiki, which hopefully will lead to something like a training curriculum useful for ongoing and new nanosafety projects and beyond.
